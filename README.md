# MovieMaster
For this assignment I needed to write a console application in Java which 
implements a simulation for hiring items from a movie store called MovieMaster.  
The staff at MovieMaster will need to be able to maintain the details for rental items that are available for 
hire by MovieMaster customers. The staff needs to be able to do operations such as apply late fees,add new items,record purchases etc.

## What I learned
OOP practices and strived for maximum data encapsulation.
Taking advantage of inheritance to reduce code duplication.
Exception handling and File persistance
